# Project 1 : Bike Sharing Project Linear Model
 
  * Created a tool that helps in predicting the number of registered bikes to be hosted at a certain location for rental purpose based on given attributes and monitoring the       available data.
  * Data collected from [UCI Machine Learning DataSource](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)
  * Feature Extraction Used to create new features that adds valuable information and make model more robust.
  * Freature transformation technique used (Log Transformation , Polynomial Transformation) for gaining more accuracy and perform trade off.
  * Achived and improved Accuracy from 61% to 88% performing feature transformation techniques.
